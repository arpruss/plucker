   <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   This document is available in CVS as well as in the source for Plucker
   itself under the ./docs directory. You can reach it via <ulink

 <sect2 id="whatisplucker">
  <title>What is Plucker?</title>

  <para>

   Plucker is a suite of programs which provide an offline web browser for
   PalmOS® handheld devices (see the section "Supported Platforms" for
   device compatibility). It's Free Software under the conditions of the
   Free Software Foundation's General Public License (GPL), so you can copy,
   change, or even sell this program without giving anyone any money, as
   long as you make the source code (and your changes, if any) publicly
   available to remain compliant with the GPL.
  </para>

  <para>
   We would, of course, be interested to see any changes you might make and
   possibly include them in a future release of Plucker. There's lots of
   things that could be added and improved!
  </para>

  <para>

   In many ways, the ideas of Plucker are similar to the proprietary AvantGo
   software, though we believe that the implementation of Plucker is much
   different than AvantGo. According to their web page, AvantGo implements
   an html parser on the Palm device; Plucker implements the majority of the
   parser on the PC/server/desktop machine. There are probably situations
   where AvantGo would be far more appropriate than Plucker (online
   browsing, for example). However, you need an SDK to work with AvantGo,
   and AvantGo is not free.

  <!-- Section 1.2: Different from AvantGo -->
  <!-- ################################### -->
  <sect2 id="diffavantgo">
   <title>In what way is Plucker different from AvantGo?</title>

   <para>
    The programs differ in many ways.
   </para>

   <para>
    Most importantly (to us, at least), Plucker is Free Software,
    distributed under the FSF's General Public License, or GPL. This means
    that if you are using Plucker, you are entitled to the source code, and
    you can change it to make it do whatever you want, as long as you make
    sure to adhere to the requirements of the GPL.
   </para>

   <para>Other differences that we know of include:</para>
   <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       AvantGo parses compressed (i.e. "encrypted") html on the Palm device
       itself; Plucker parses uncompressed html on the server, and sends an
       interpreted version to the Palm.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Plucker appears to render documents faster (though it hasn't been
       optimized for speed, really)
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The "home" Plucker page is a user-defined html document, and is
       treated just like any other. The "home" AvantGo page does not appear
       to be html; it's determined by the AvantGo configuration software.
       So, the history buttons don't work from the Home page in AvantGo.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Plucker will support drag-n-drop (DND) html files. As far as we know,
       AvantGo does not.

 <sect2 id="howdoes">
  <title>How does Plucker work?</title>

  <para>
   Plucker consists of three parts: the parser, the conduit, and the viewer. 
   The parser and the conduit have been merged into one complete Python
   version and eventually there will also be a Perl version of the parser.
   The standalone conduit is written in Perl and there is also a conduit
   written in Delphi for the Windows users.
  </para>

  <para>
   The parser runs on your main computer (the one with the HotSync cradle or
   IR port physically attached to it, or on a networked machine which allows
   you to connect to it via Network Hotsync). It gathers the web pages you
   specify and follows the links on those pages to a chosen depth
   (specified by you).  You specify the web pages you want to gather by
   creating a "home.html" file, which also becomes your home page. The links
   on "home.html" are followed to a depth specified by the optional
   "maxdepth" attribute which you can include in the &lt;a href="..."&gt;
   tag in the home.html file.  The parser finds new links to retrieve and
   converts the pages to a format that the viewer can read.
  </para>

  <para>
   The conduit takes the converted html files from a directory or from your
   computer's system memory (RAM; using the python parser) and places them
   in a database on your Palm device, or directs them to a file (which is
   the same as the database) on your desktop, which you can sync to your
   emulator or your "real" Palm device at a later time.
  </para>

  <para>
   The viewer displays the converted html files on your Palm device's
   screen.  It allows you to use the stylus to tap on links which will then
   display the target page. It has a 32-page history, so you can move
   backwards and forwards through the pages just as you would with your
   desktop browser.
  </para>

  <para>
   Rendering is done in part by the parser (which works out things like
   which styles to use) and in part by the viewer (which works out line and
   document lengths, and renders &lt;A&gt;nchor tags).
  </para>

 <sect2 id="cantsee">
  <title>Why can't I see any images on my Palm device?</title>

  <para> 
   Either you have an old version of Plucker (image support was added in
   version 0.03) or you haven't installed all necessary tools. The Palm
   device uses a format called Tbmp (Tiny Bitmap) for its images, and the
   parser in Plucker needs (among others) a special tool called ppmtoTbmp to
   be able to convert images to the Palm OS bitmap format (depending on your
   version of Plucker, you may no longer need to use the ppmtoTbmp tool. It
   has recently been replaced by the netpbm2 package). Check out the
   REQUIREMENTS file in the main source archive for a list of necessary
   tools and where to find them.

   <para>
    When you generate 2 or 4 bpp images you have to change the bit depth of
    the screen to view them. The default depth is 1 (Black/White), so when
    the viewer finds images of a higher bit depth it will display [img Nbpp]
    instead (N = bit depth for the image). You change the bit depth in the

  </title>

   <para>
    Plucker documents can be built with an 'owner-id', which must correspond
    to the HotSync ID on a Palm for the document to be opened on that Palm. 
    This is similar to the document-locking schemes used by many commercial
    sites.  Use the --owner-id switch on the parser to do this.

    By setting the compression key in the configuration file (.pluckerrc for

    use ZLib instead of DOC compression for the databases. You can always
    change this behavior at run-time by using the --zlib-compression or the
    --doc-compression options.

   Well, the old legacy parser (a bunch of awk scripts) was only a temporary
   solution and have been replaced with a Python-based parser. That should
   make it easier to comprehend what it actually does! We believe that the
   rendering of documents for the Palm device should be specialized, so we
   intend to continue to render the documents in the parser/viewer.

   If you haven't looked at the viewer since 0.02 then you would probably be
   surprised. The single source file of version 0.02 has been split up in   
   several files and the viewer is approaching being optimal, but there are 
   some issues, particularly with implied structure coupling, and lack of   
   documentation, both of which we wish to address.

   The conduit is not clever. It will upload pages to the database even if
   they already exist and have not changed. This should obviously be fixed so
   that a full 360 degree synchronization process can be achieved.

   <title>What are some of the features of Plucker?</title>

   <para>
    Plucker has many, many features which make it very useful for a lot of
    different purposes and reading habits of a diverse set of users and
    platforms. Here are just a few:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Plucker is designed for off-line browsing on a small screen. It
      doesn't attempt to make html pages look like they appear on a monitor;
      instead, it tries to make them readable and useful.

    future:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Frames (it might be possible to implement this in a links kind of way

     <para>
      We intend to integrate Plucker with the popular free desktop
      environments (such as KDE and GNOME). In these environments it would
      be great if you could Drag-'n'-Drop a URL into the Palm device for
      off-line viewing.
