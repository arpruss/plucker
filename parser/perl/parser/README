	Ok, after a long hiatus of me not working on the parser, here
        lies yet another complete rewrite from the ground up. This one
        is very *VERY* fast, has some new little tricks in it, and works
        very well. It's much faster in the gather process than the
        current Python parser is.

	**** WARNING ******
	###################

	Although this parser is 100% stable, do not expect this to do
        everything the python parser does right now. My local copy does,
        but that one is not stable enough for production work. Basically
        this one will allow you to bring down web content and images up
        to --maxdepth, and then you can use the python parser with the
        file:/foo syntax to build you a proper database.

	Run it like this: 

        perl ./plucke-rget.pl http://www.freshmeat.net/ --maxdepth=1 --verbose

        Feedback (and help fixing some of the buglets) is greatly
        appreciated.

	I've added two copies of the parser here, so please feel free to
        help use fix them, and roll them into production use. They
        both have slightly different scanning/gathering engines, so try
        them both.

	Ok, this is where the parser is going to make it's home. I'm
        going to be cleaning up the code very soon, just spending a lot
        of time porting some tools over, so I could build the viewer,
        and making the cvs server a tad more stable, and adding a web
        page for the cvs server.
