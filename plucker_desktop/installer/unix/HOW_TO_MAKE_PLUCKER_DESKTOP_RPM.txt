When distributing, make sure the version is correct in the CVS spec file.
The "Release" is what will be after the version number. For example if release is 5,
then filename will be plucker-desktop-1.4.0.0-5.i386.rpm.

Add a changelog entry to the specfile.

Make a folder of the *entire* plucker source tree. Perhaps not entire, ask can strip out stuff not needed for a mkinstalldirs, configure,etc
The top level folder of tree needs to be renamed plucker-desktop-1.4.0.0 (replacing 1.4.0.0 with version).
Use commandline or a GUI archiver to make a plucker-desktop-1.4.0.0.tar.gz (replacing 1.4.0.0 with version).
Check inside the archive to be sure that everything is inside a root level plucker-desktop.1.4.0.0 directory

Login as superuser and copy that tar.gz file into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
Still in superuser, cd to the plucker/plucker_desktop/installer/unix/ directory 
from your source code somewhere. There should be a plucker-desktop.spec file in this dir.
Then type: rpmbuild -ba plucker-desktop.spec

Should now have an RPM appear in 
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS
and a source RPM appear in
/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS
