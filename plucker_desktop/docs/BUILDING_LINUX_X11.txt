IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

wxGTK is *much* more stable and mature than wxX11. wxX11 is only 
experimental at this stage. To use on POSIX systems, using wxGTK  
instead of wxX11 is strongly recommended.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

You need: 
(a) wxWindows: wxX11 version 2.3.3 or higher
(b) GCC

BUILDING
--------

This is almost exactly the same as GTK. It is recommended to read 
BUILDING_LINUX_GTK.txt
The only thing that is different is the ./configure command at the start.
For x11 it is:

./configure --with-x11 --disable-shared --with-univ \
    --with-debug_flag --enable-log --with-debug_info \
    --enable-debug --without-threads --without-sockets \ 
    --without-odbc -with-libjpeg --enable-debug_cntxt \
    --disable-no_rtti
