BUILDING_MS_VC6SP5

This is for Visual C++ 6, later versions may be similar. There are tips in the docs that come with wxWidgets
for other Visual C++ versions, as well as a wxWiki. Because we are building the application at the same level
in the wx directory tree as the samples, if you can get the wx samples to compile, you should get Plucker Desktop
to compile.

To build the debug and release unicode (which is all that Plucker Desktop is supporting as of 2007), 
meaning only NT, 2000, XP, Vista and above.

First get Visual C++ 6 installed, with SP6 (SP6 available from microsoft as a download).

Download wxWidgets from wxwidgets.org and run the setup installer.

The directory where you installed wxWidgets will heretofore be referred to as <wxdir>

Open the <wxdir>/build/msw/wx.dsw

In the left pane, right click to bring up the file ../include/wx/msw/setup.h
In the line far down, and change the
#define wxUSE_UNICODE 0
to
#define wxUSE_UNICODE 1

In menu: Build > Batch Build... > and go through the list and only check off
the ones that say either
Win32 unicode release
or
win32 unicode debug
[ie NOT the ones that have neither the word 'Universal' nor have the word 'DLL']

In menu: Build > Batch Build > Build to build all those checked libraries.

Test that things are working by opening up the minimal wx sample in <wxdir>/samples/minimal.dsw
In menu: Build > Set Active Configuration and choose the minimal Unicode Debug. (or release if releasing).

The wxWidgets makefile system and libraries keep changing so fast, for Visual C, I just compile plucker_desktop on MSW and OSW from within the wxTree.
To do so, spark up CVS, and check out the "plucker" module into your <wxwin> directory. This will result in the folder of
<wxwin>/plucker/plucker_desktop/
This folder is thus now at the same level as the examples.

Open up <wxwin>/plucker/plucker_desktop/<wxwin>/plucker/plucker_desktop/plucker-desktop.dsw 

From the menu, choose Build > Set Active Target > "plucker-desktop unicode debug"

To run it, in needs to load up the runtime resources. It looks in two possible places (via the registry), or a local file down from the current directory 
Option one: install a recent release of Plucker Desktop, so that you get the folder like C:\Program Files\Plucker\plucker_desktop\resources folder made, and copy the matching resource files from CVS into that folder, or:

Option two: moving the plucker-desktop.exe [and plucker-desktop.exe.manifest] <wxdir>/plucker/, and then double-click to run.
