BUILDING ON OPEN WATCOM: 
Open Watcom should work, but I don't have a full makefile yet for it (will probably use bakefile instead).

This was done for WindowsXP.

(1) Download and install OpenWatcom. Just leave all the default install options alone.

(2) Download and install wxWidgets. Just leave all the default install options alone. In this example, the install directory was C:\wxWidgets-2.8.4

(3) I did this, so that can just have a WXDIR variable in the Plucker Desktop makefiles:
-Go to Start > Control Panel > Settings > System > Advanced tab > Environmental Variables button, and added these to the "User Variables' section:
WXDIR = C:\wxWidgets-2.8.4
WXWIN = C:\wxWidgets-2.8.4

(4) You need a command prompt. On Windows XP, a less-crippled one is at Start > Accessories > Command Prompt. 
[ Note: If you instead would have chose to type "Command" at the Start > Run prompt you seem to get some old commandline that is less usable.

(5) Anyways, in the commandprompt, cd to C:\wxWidgets-2.8.4\build\msw
and type:
wmake -f makefile.wat

(6) Wait until compiles. All done. 

To test it, go to C:\wxWidgets\samples\minimal and again type
wmake -f makefile.wat
The compiled .exe is at:
C:\wxWidgets\samples\minima\wat_mswd\minimal.exe
Double click it to start. Nice!

(7) Now just need to throw together a makefile for plucker-desktop. 
I started one, using the <wxdir>/samples/xrc/makefile.wat as an example, changing the names of the files, and it worked out well.
