   <para>
      This manual describes Plucker, an off-line HTML viewer for your Palm OS handheld device. Plucker increase the
      utility of your handheld device by letting you view web pages and any document that can be converted to HTML or
      text. Plucker has many advanced features including the ability to read web pages with embedded images, an
      advanced find function, the ability to open an e-mail form when tapping on mail-links in web documents, an
      impressive compression ratio for the documents and an open, documented DB format. It can also be customized for
      your specific needs.  And not to be forgotten the source code is available for your perusal.
   </para>
                                                                                                                                         
   <para>
      The general layout of this document is as follows. First we will list the necessary components you need to run
      Plucker and give you a short introduction on how Plucker works. Then we will give detailed instructions about the
      installation on your system if there are any specific parts for the operating system you use. After the setup
      routine of Plucker we will show you how to customize Plucker to get the contents.
   </para>
                                                                                                                                         
   <para>
      As a general guideline we strongly encourage you to read at least the first three chapters of this handbook. When
      you understand how Plucker works it is easy to set up the advanced features using the reference part of this
      book.

            Plucker will run on Palm Pro, Palm III, Palm IIIx/IIIe, Palm V, PalmVx, Handspring Visor, TRGPro and other
            Palm OS handheld devices utilizing PalmOS 2.0 and higher.
         </para>
   
         <para>
            Plucker requires 98 kB of free space for the viewer application and an additional 30 kB for the shared
            library if the ZLib compression should be used (only PalmOS 3.0 and higher can use the zlib compression).
         </para>

         <para>
            Additional free space is required for your data and at run-time for decompression. An alert will display if
            there is not enough free space on your device. Note that Plucker can use documents stored in Flash memory
            and on read-only expansion cards.
         </para>

         <para>
            NOTE: The higher bit depth (more colors) you use for the images the more memory they will require, so it is
            recommended not to use higher bit depth than necessary. See below on how to influence the bit depth Plucker
            uses.

         <title>How Plucker Works</title>
         <para>
            Let us start with a short description on how Plucker works. This
            will help you to understand certain procedures necessary to use
            Plucker to its best.
         </para>

         <para>First of all let us mention that there are three parts:</para>

         <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>
                  The Viewer: this is the actual application you run on your handheld. It is used to display your
                  documents as the name suggests.
               </para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para> 
                  The Parser: more or less the brain of Plucker. The parser gathers contents from the Internet and
                  converts it to a suitable format for the viewer. This part is installed on your workstation, not on
                  your handheld, so unlike other products Plucker uses your powerful desktop for the hard work.
               </para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>
                  Some transfer tool which sends the pages you gathered using the parser to your handheld. Actually,
                  this is not part of Plucker itself and how this is done depends on the platform you are using. For
                  example, on Unix or OS/2 you might want to use Pilot-Link whereas on Windows you might prefer to use
                  the HotSync Manager. It is only necessary that you understand that you must, in some way, transfer
                  the data in any way to your handheld. We stress this here as many users who converted from some other
                  application to Plucker missed this point.
               </para>
            </listitem>
         </orderedlist>

         <para>Consequences of this are immediate:</para>
                                                                                                                                         
         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>
                  Before you are able to view any page from the Web on your handheld you have to run the parser
                  (sometime also called HotSync in this document). Normally you will invoke it via some script, which
                  we will explain later on. Plucker does not start the gathering process automatically when you press
                  the HotSync button on your cradle as some other off-line web readers do (not even on Windows). We
                  want to stress that you must start the parser manually (or by some tool that does this automatically
                  for you), and after running the parser you must sync your device to get the documents onto your
                  handheld. What sounds a bit difficult offers you in fact many advantages.
               </para>
            </listitem>                                                                                                                          

            <listitem>
               <para>
                  Since the parser is separated from the viewer and the transfer tool you will not have any problems if
                  your HotSync-cradle shares the COM-port with your modem.
               </para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>
                  It is possible to run the parser automatically at some specified time. That is you can have Plucker
                  to collect your newspaper each morning at six o'clock without requiring your attention and then
                  HotSync the retrieved data to your handheld before you leave home. In fact the whole process can be
                  automated through a shareware tool such as AutoSync from <ulink
                  url="http://www.rgps.com">http://www.rgps.com</ulink>, cron jobs, or other similar tools.
               </para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

         <para>
            Before you can read a document (HTML/text file) it has to be converted to a Plucker format. For this we
            need some converters.  The provided parser tool is the most essential, but to get support for images as
            well you might want to read on as we need some 3rd party applications for that as well. That is, if you
            lack images in your gathered web pages most likely you are missing some of the necessary tools.
         </para>

         <para>
            The provided parser tool currently runs on Linux, OS/2, Windows, Solaris, AIX and FreeBSDIt should be
            possible to get it running on any platform with Python support.
         </para>                  
                                                                                                                                         
         <para>
            NOTE: On OS/2 you must install Plucker on a HPFS-partition.  Plucker will not run on OS/2 if you are using
            the FAT file system as Plucker requires long filenames and OS/2 implements the traditional way of FAT
            without the extensions known from Windows.
         </para>

            If you know of other platforms where Plucker can be used successfully we would appreciate if you send a
            message to <email>plucker-team&#064;rubberchicken.org&#46;com</email> informing us about it and if possible

      This chapter describes how to set up Plucker on your system and how to configure it to gather contents for
      you. It does not cover all features of Plucker for which you might refer to later chapters of this handbook,
      but it will give you an introduction on how to use Plucker's basic features. Many of the advanced topics are
      not covered here to make this introduction readable even for beginners and as simple as possible. Once you got
      the generals procedures of Plucker it will be easy for you to understand the later parts of this handbook
      which are meant mainly as reference guide.

                  The Expert: You may obtain all packages you need to run Plucker separately and set them up by
                  hand. This would be the preferred way if you have already several packages installed on your
                  system (unless you work a lot with Unix-style tools on OS/2 this is not very likely the case) and
                  if you have some experiences setting up such stuff.

            <listitem>
               <para>
                  The Beginner: Just get the WarpIn-Installation packages and run install. This is the preferred way
                  for new and/or inexperienced users and if you do not have the main parts to run Plucker installed
                  on your system.  Unless specific circumstances or environments we encourage you to use this way! 
                  The OS/2-installer will do no harm to your system and it will make it quite easy to de-install
                  Plucker.

         <para>
            NOTE: Currently there persist still some problems with image conversion on OS/2 so you might not be able

                     of WarpIn.) After this open that folder and double-click on WarpIn.exe. This will create the
                     necessary program objects and associations to use WarpIn. Note that WarpIn is not written
                     explicitly for Plucker and that we only use it. For details about WarpIn refer to its README
                     files and documentation. WarpIn is Freeware.

                     they are now associated with WarpIn.) This fires up WarpIn which asks you some basic questions
                     on where you want to store the files and stuff like that. Simply follow the

                     The installer will create a folder on your Desktop called Plucker for OS/2 which will contain
                     all necessary objects for using Plucker. Additionally it will set up Python and Pilot-Link as
                     well as ImageMagick for image conversion.

               documentation, just in case there is anything different on OS/2 than on all the other platforms. You
               may note that this is very rarely the case at all.

               Plucker.

         means that you can view home.html in your normal web browser (e.g. Netscape). In fact you can even use a
         normal web page at some web server as your home document. See chapter refsec:Parser for details on how to
         do this.
      </para>

      <para>
         Prior to performing a HotSync, you have to tell Plucker about where to grab the pages that you want to
         view. Plucker starts by scanning the description file (also refered to as home document) that you have
         defined. As stated above if you did not define otherwise this will be $HOME/.plucker/home.html.
      </para>

      <para>
         The parser finds any links in that file, and follows them. Each link (e.g. something like <![CDATA[<a href="...">]]>)
         is read from the Internet, stored and parsed on your hard disk and included in the document that you will
         later sync to your Palm. Let us explore the description file in more detail.
      </para>

      <para>
         A simple, typical home document will look like this (without the line numbers, they are only added for
         easier reference later on):
      </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
[01] <h1>Plucker Home</h1>
[02]
[03] <h2>Plucker Information</h2>
[04]   <p><A HREF="http://www.plkr.org"> Plucker home page</a></p>

[06] <h2>Linux links</h2>

]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Here you see several typical examples. First of all you may note that this document follows the general
         outlines of normal HTML as stated above. If you do not know HTML already, do not worry. What you need here
         is really very easy. Let us look it trough line by line. (If you already know HTML this will be somewhat
         boring to you).
      </para>

      <para>
         First you note that commands in HTML are enclosed in angle brackets. Each command has a begin and an end
         always using the same tag, the end tag is marked by an additional slash in front of the tag's name. Lines 1,
         3, 6, and 9 line create Headlines.  The numbers simply specify different heights of the lettering.
      </para>

      <para>
         More interesting is the 4th line. First it starts a new paragraph (<![CDATA[<p>]]>) and then you see the
         most important tag in HTML: a "link". Links have the following form:
      </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<a href="http://www.plkr.org">Plucker home page</a>
]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Enclosed in quotes you find the page they refer to (the URL) then after an closing angle bracket you see
         the title of the link that should be displayed to the user. You will see exactly this text within Plucker
         on your home document.
      </para>

      <para>
         Now you have the basic procedure how to tell Plucker to get a specific web page for you. What does Plucker
         do if it finds a tag like this in home.html? It will simply follow the URL you specified and get this page.
         Note that as this page is plain HTML you can also view it within your normal web browser and use the links
         the same way as Plucker does it. That way you can easily check if all links are working as you expected
         without the need to run the parser each time and sync.
      </para>

      <para>
         Well, it is nice to grab a web page, but what to do with a newsticker that lists only the headlines? You
         want to retrieve the articles as well. Let's have a look at line 7. You will note that this time the link
         is enhanced by an additional tag: MAXDPTH=2. This is the way to instruct Plucker to retrieve deeper levels
         from a web server. You can give MAXDEPTH any number as parameter. MAXDEPTH=2 means to load the target
         (linked-to) page, and any targets within that page. This will just do the job. It will first grab the
         headlines and then follow all linked pages to get the articles as well.
      </para>

      <para>
         MAXDEPTH=3 will load the target page, its linked pages, and any pages linked within there and so on. You
         really do not want to set MAXDEPTH too high. That could be very bad. A MAXDEPTH of well under 50 would
         probably load the entire Internet, so you may run into some storage problems...
      </para>

      <para>
         MAXDEPTH is one of the most important tags used to customize the information to download. Another important
         tag is NOIMAGES. A sample on how to use it can be found in line 7. If you do not want to download any
         images you should specify this tag. Simply add it after the URL to pluck. As you see in line 7 you can
         combine the various tags. That is line 7 instructs Plucker to download only the title pages without images.
         You see you can even explicitly specify a value of 1 to the MAXDEPTH argument. This does not make much
         sense at the first glance as our first example showed that leaving out the MAXDEPTH statement will give the
         same result. But stop. The reason to give a explicit MAXDEPTH is that you can define which depth is the
         default for Plucker within Pluckers configuration file we will talk about later on. So if you set the
         default depth to 2 e.g. but this page should definitely be plucked only to a depth of 1 you can specify it
         explicitly here instead of defining a depth of 2 for all other pages. (It is not a bad idea to define the
         depth explicitly for all pages as one can see at first glance how deep Plucker will work.)
      </para>

      <para>
         Now in line 7 you see another possibility of Plucker. You might have wondered about these funny chars that
         appear in the url. Well with that definition you instruct Plucker to request the result of a so called CGI
         and to pass some paraeters as well. A CGI is basically a script run by a web provider to gather explicit
         informations e.g. from a database. You do not need to worry about the details, the easiest way to get the
         correct URL is always to point your web browser to the page where the information is located and copy the
         URL from its URL-field into the home-document of Plucker. Here we just wanted to show that Plucker can even
         handle such funny URLs.
      </para>

      <para>
         Hint: If you specify a CGI for a newsticker and you always get the same news it is most likely that the
         date of the issue is passed to the script via the URL.
      </para>

      <para>
         NOTE: MAXDEPTH will most likely be sufficient for web pages that where written for PDAs. If you are
         plucking normal web pages be careful with MAXDEPTH, as many pages contain a menu to navigate the site and
         Plucker will follow these links as well. That is Plucker does not distinguish between a menu or a normal
         link. That way a MAXDEPTH=2 which is meant to download an overview page and the articles (e.g. of your
         newspaper) could easily result in Plucker trying to retrieve the news archive of your favourite newspaper
         as well (since it is linked from within the menu). So it is wise to attend the first runs of Plucker if you
         add new pages to your description file, especially if you do not use PDA-optimized pages.  There are very
         effective ways to prevent Plucker from running into this kind of problems. Besides the MAXDEPTH and
         NOIMAGES tags there are various other tags that influlence the gathering process. E.g. you can have Plucker
         to exclude specific links etc. See below in chapter refsec:Parser for details about. We will not go into to
         much details here.
      </para>

      <para>
         Hint: Web pages created for handhelds have some advantages over normal web pages. Plucker can retrieve
         normal web pages, no matter, but specially designed pages are normally smaller, contain less graphics etc.
      </para>

      <para>
         Hint: Plucker can not handle frames. Usually, pages designed for handhelds do not contain frames...
      </para>

      <para>
         Hint: A good collection of links to handheld friendly sites are included with Plucker.

   <sect1 id="bc">
   <title>Running the Parser</title>

      <para>
         Now that you have created your description file you are ready to run the parser to get the pages. For our
         simple case here this does not require much. Simply open a command line window, change to the directory
         where you installed the python parser and run the following (% is the shell prompt)
      </para>

      <programlisting>% python PyPlucker/Spider.py -f PluckerDB</programlisting>

      <para>
         (This call will work on any system, on Unix you can leave out the explicit call to Python of course.) Make
         sure you have established a connection to the Internet before you issue this call.
      </para>

      <para>
         Now the parser will read your freshly created home.html follow the links the way you defined them and
         finally write a file to your harddisk called PluckerDB.pdb. In case of problems you might want to add the
         additional parameter -V2 to see where the error occurs.
      </para>

      <para>
         NOTE: The spider has plenty of parameters. You will find a detailed description of all of them in chapter
         refsec:Parser. Additionally to the parameters specified to the parser call you can set default values in a
         file called <emphasis>plucker.ini</emphasis> (on OS/2 and Windows) or .pluckerrc (on Unix). So if something
         happens that you did not expect it is a good idea to check this file. A detailed description of the
         parameters for this file and its format can also be found in chapter refsec:Parser and within the file
         itself.

      <para>
         After you ran the parser on your system it will generate a document for you, that is a file suitable for
         the viewer. Of course you need to transfer this document to your handheld. By default we suggest the usage
         of pilot-xfer. pilot-xfer is one of the tools (more or less the central tool) of the famous pilot-link
         package which is available for numerous platforms.  For Unix and OS/2 you might find both the binary and
         the source distribution at:

      <para>
         Besides that Plucker offers its own conduit for Windows which cooperates directly with the usual HotSync,
         and there is as well a perl-based conduit available which you can still use to transfer the data (though
         you might only want to use it in very special circumstances, and in fact we discourage its usage).

         <para>
            Though the general usage of Pilot-Link package is beyond the scope of this manual we will tell you
            enough to transfer your documents on the Palm using Pilot-Link. On Unix and OS/2 you have mainly two
            choices:
         </para>

         <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>
                  Create a document with the parser and
                  transfer that one

               </para>
            </listitem>
         </orderedlist>

         <para>
            We encourage you to use the first method as it is easier and does not require working perl and
            pilot-link's perl-interface on your system. The perl based conduit may offer you some advantages though,
            so its covered in the advanced topics.  Please have a look there.
         </para>

         <para>
            The usage of pilot-xfer is quite simple. Provided you set up the package correctly (on OS/2 this is done
            by the installer) all you need to do is
         </para>

         <programlisting>% pilot-xfer -i FILE ...</programlisting>

         <para>
            This will prompt you to press the HotSync button and then transfer the document to your handheld. On
            OS/2 you can of course use the WPS to do this.  Simply open the folder where you stored your documents
            and double-click on the one you want to install. (The GUI-installer has set up he appropriate
            connections for you already.)
         </para>

         <para>
            Hint: In case you have more than one document to
            transfer you can also use the -r switch and invoke
            pilot-link the following way to transfer all documents
            within a directory at once
         </para>

         <programlisting>% pilot-xfer -r DIR</programlisting>

         <para>
            Hint: For OS/2 users. If you need to do this very often you might want to enhance the context menu of
            your document folder by this function. Actually this is quite easy. Just create a program object that
            contains the necessary call with all parameters needed (in the program field just enter pilot-xfer.exe,
            in the parameters field you might want to enter -r ..  Note the full-stop in the argument), then open
            your folder settings and go to the Menu page. Now simply drop the newly created program object in the
            lower list box and name it appropriately using the Settings.. button. Now the context menu of your
            folder will have an additional entry to transfer the whole folder to your handheld. You might want to
            generate a shadow of that folder on your desktop for easy access.

         <title>The Windows Conduit</title>

         <para>
            The Windows conduit is, unlike pilot-link, entirely
            written for Plucker. For that it offers some
            parameters quite specific which we will elaborate a
            bit about here. Additionally it transfers the data not
            directly to the Palm but notifies the Hotsync Manager
            about a document waiting for transfer, that is the
            document is sent to your handheld on your next
            HotSync-operation, not like on Unix when you call the
            conduit.
         </para>

         <para>
            The first difference in the usage is that it is
            thought to be used with cache-directories. That is it
            assumes that you run the parser using -c. The new
            version supports the transfer of a complete document
            as well though.

            All parameters are in the form <emphasis role="strong">-parameter=value</emphasis>. Note that
            they do not follow POSIX conventions nor the normal
            DOS-conventions. Use one minus sign to separate all
            parameters. If you specify no parameter at all you
            will get a short help message.

            <emphasis role="strong">-cache</emphasis>: The name of the cache-directory if you use the
            parser with the -c switch. The default value is Cache
            if you do not provide that parameter. This path is
            given relative to the path you provided with -dir.
         </para>

            <emphasis role="strong">-dbname</emphasis>: Name of the document, that is the name with
            which the document will show up on the Palm. Default
            is PluckerDB.  You will want to change this, and you
            have to change it if you want multiple documents.
         </para>

         <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">-fname</emphasis>: Filename for the document on your local
            harddisk. Default PluckerDB.pdb. You need to change
            this for multiple documents.
         </para>

         <para>
            <emphasis role="strong">-install</emphasis>: Install a document. This parameter is needed
            instead of -cache if you run the parser with the -f
            switch. -user must be set, -dir must not

         After you successully retrieved your documents and enjoyed reading them on your PDA you might want to do
         this every day. To ease things up consider putting these calls into a short script file. On OS/2 and
         Windows simly create a file called hotsync.cmd (OS/2) or hotsync.bat (Windows) and place the calls just
         like you would have entered them on the command prompt. In case you use dial up conections to the internet
         you can even include the calls to build up that connection before the gathering process starts.

         Now you should be ready to start using Plucker. The next chapter will describe the client application on
         your handheld, the Viewer.

      Using Plucker's client application (in this chapter refered to as the viewer) is in many ways just like using a
      normal web browser (except for the fact that you are not connected to the Internet).

         This section describes how to start the viewer and navigate between different pages. If you are new to
         Plucker, read this section to get used to its basic operations. Later sections will describe how to customize
         the viewer in many ways, handling of multiple documents, the find function, and how to add bookmarks.

            Tap on the Plucker icon in the Applications screen to start the viewer. The first time the viewer is
            started it will open the document library and display the available document in RAM and, if the device is
            equipped with external card(s), any documents on the card(s). Subsequent launches of the viewer will start
            where you left off.

         <title>The Main Screen</title>

         <para>
            The viewer will render the pages as close to the original as possible, using everything from italic and
            bold fonts to embedded images. It also support horizontal rules, ordered and unordered lists, headers
            (using different font sizes), left, right, and center text alignment, and justified text.

         <para>
            The toolbar can be moved from the top to the bottom of the screen or removed completely using preference
            settings (see refsec:Prefs).
         </para>

         <para>
            The viewer has a 32 page history, so you can easily move backward and forward through recent visited pages
            just as you would with your desktop browser.
         </para>

         <para>
            There are several different ways to move within the current page and perform different actions. You can
            move using the scrollbar, the scroll buttons and if the tap action (see refsec:TapAction), gesture action
            (see refsec:Gestures), and button action (see refsec:HWButtons) are activated also by pen taps on the
            screen, gestures in the graffiti area and by pressing the hardware buttons, respectively. The fastest way
            to move within the page is to use the location selector, though. Tap on the location (the percentage in the
            toolbar) and a dropdown menu will appear with 11 different values, Top, 10%, 20%,...90%, and Bottom, so
            that you can choose the location you want to jump to. Tapping the autoscroll buttons will cause the text to
            scroll by at the specified rate (see refsec:Autoscroll.
         </para>

         <para>
            Just like a web browser the viewer underlines links, a solid line for not visited pages and a dotted line
            for already visited pages. Tap on an underlined link to open the page it refers to (the link will be
            highlighted when you tap on it).  Image links are not underlined but it should be obvious when an embedded
            image is a link and when it is not. When in doubt just tap on the image, if it highlights it is an image
            link...
         </para>

         <para>
            Embedded images will be scaled down if they are too big to fit within the available width of the screen. If
            the alternative image options are activated (see refsec:Parser), then the embedded images will be a link to
            a larger version of itself. Tap on the image and the larger version will be shown. The viewer will try to
            change the screen depth to the depth required by the Tbmp document and if that depth is not supported it
            will display an alert. To see all parts of the larger-than-screen image, tap on it and drag the pen in all
            directions.
         </para>

         <para>
            When you tap on an e-mail tag the viewer will open a form so that you can compose and send a message. The
            form will show as much as possible of the To: Cc: and Subj: lines. If they don't fit on one line a little
            arrow will appear next to the line to allow you to see the rest of the line. The message will be sent
            through the built-in Mail application (i.e. you have to enable the mail synchronization using the Hotsync
            options (Windows) or some external tool (other platforms) to send the mail).

            When such a link is followed the viewer will display a page with the URL for the external reference. You
            can tap Copy URL and the URL will be added to a Memo in the Memo database.

         <para>
            The Memo will be titled Plucker URLs <![CDATA[<date> <time>]]>. All URLs added during a single Plucker

            In the Font and Layout dialog you can set various layout options. Depending on your device, you may have up
            to five built-in font packages, and on most devices if you install an appropriate custom font package, you
            will be able to load it in by choosing it from the User-loaded font drop down list. You can also set
            line-spacing, paragraph-spacing and rotation options.

            User loaded Plucker font packages may be placed either in your device's RAM, or in VFS storage, if

  /Palm/Ebooks/Fonts
  /Palm/Launcher/

         It is possible to make a case-insensitive or case-sensitive search and also to choose between only searching
         in the current record, in all records in the document, in all records starting with the present point, or
         recursively in sub- pages, i.e., pages linked from this one and so on. Moreover, you can choose to search for
         a phrase (all the characters entered must be in the document as entered) or for a number of words in a
         paragraph in which case each space separated sequence of characters in the search string must occur in the
         same paragraph (but need not appear as a complete word).
      </para>

      <para>
         More sophisticated than case-insensitive searches are transliteration searches. These transliterate the text
         in the document according to a a fixed transliteration table before searching. This can be used to search for
         accented characters without knowing what the accentuation is or to search for characters in the document's
         encoding that are difficult to enter via Graffiti or that your Palm localization does not support, but that
         are supported via a custom font. You can make your own transliteration tables via the tools in the source code
         viewer/xlit directory. Each transliteration table is a separate .pdb database. Here are some common ones.

         Except for PBGreekKeys.pdb, all the transliterations are symmetric, i.e. the transliteration is applied not just to the
         document before searching but also to the entered search text. So if you use the `Drop Latin 1 accents before searching''
         option and search for b, you will also find b, aba, ab, etc.

         When you tap on the document icon in front of each document a pop-up list will appear providing you with
         different operations for the selected document:

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         Also, a tap on a document in the list will open it right away.
      </para>

      <para>
         You can also select documents with jog-dial, five-way navigator, or, if the list is sorted by document name,
         by entering the first couple letters of the document name.
      </para>

      <para>
         If the document is in flash (or read-only for some other reason) it is not possible to delete or rename it.
         The viewer will show an alert if you still try to perform such an action on the document.
      </para>

      <para>
         The documents can be compressed either using the DOC method or ZLib. Support for the DOC method is included by
         default in the viewer so documents compressed with that method can always be viewed. ZLib compressed documents
         requires the ZLib shared library and if this library is not installed the viewer will alert the user about
         this. Palm OS 2.x devices can only handle DOC compressed documents.
      </para>

      <para>
         Each document can be in one or several categories and it is possible to filter the list of documents by
         selecting what categories that should be shown.
      </para>

      <para>
         The viewer will check the following directories on external cards for Plucker documents,

      <para>
         In the category screen you can add, remove and rename categories. Tap on the pushbutton with the category name
         to toggle between hiding and showing the category. Check the box MULTIPLE SELECT to allow more than one
         category to be displayed at a time. To add a new category, tap on an empty pushbutton. The document icon next
         to each category provides you with the options to delete and rename a category. If you delete a category name,
         the documents filed under that name will become unfiled documents. To merge documents in different categories,
         rename one category to the other category name.

<chapter id="d">
   <title>Plucker Plugin Interface</title>

   <para>
      The Plucker Plugin Interface (PPI) is a separate program (e.g., ppi_en.prc) used to interface Plucker with
      external programs like dictionaries. To use PPI to look up words, configure the Viewer as described in
      refsec:Lookup.
   </para>   

   <para>   
      PPI has hard-coded settings for the popular dictionary programs RoadLingua, KDic DA, and BDicty. To use with
      other dictionaries or encyclopedias, ask their customer support for appropriate data to enter into the Custom
      setting.
   </para>   

   <para>   
      The RoadLingua dictionary viewer is commercial, but the developer has made the free (as in beer) unregistered
      version act like the registered version (at least with non-commercial dictionary texts) when it is invoked via
      PPI. You may need the latest version of RoadLingua for this from <ulink url="http://www.absoluteword.com">http://www.absoluteword.com</ulink>.
   </para>   

   <para>   
      Note that when using the free version of BDicty, the word will be put into the clipboard and will need to be
      pasted into BDicty.
   </para>   

   <para>   
      PPI is available for use with other programs than Plucker. For instance, currently PalmBible+ uses it for its
      dictionary lookup; see: <ulink url="http://palmbibleplus.sf.net">http://palmbibleplus.sf.net</ulink>.

   <title>The Parser</title>

   <para>
      As pointed out in the previous chapter the parser is more or less the workhorse of Plucker. This implies that
      most customizations are done to the parser and that the parser covers a rather big part of this manual.

      <title>Description file</title>

      <para>
         Before we take a closer look at the parser itself, we will describe the format of the description file also
         known as the Home Page document (default home.html, but that can be changed). On a Unix/Linux system this file
         will be stored by default in $HOME/.plucker.
      </para>

      <para>
         OS/2 will use the environment-variable HOME to find the location of your home-directory (you can also use
         drive letters).  The installer should set the necessary environment variable for you and also add the
         necessary directories to your system.  You may check the location by simply typing set home at a command
         prompt.
      </para>

      <para>
         The description file is a valid HTML document with extra optional tags added for the link references.
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               MAXDEPTH=n: This specifies how deep the parser should follow the links embedded in a web page. If
               MAXDEPTH is not given the parser will default to a depth of 1, that is only download the page itself but
               do not follow any links in it. To follow links in the current page you would use MAXDEPTH=2 and to
               follow links also in those pages you would use MAXDEPTH=3 and so on. Too high values without using any
               of the available filtering mechanisms could result in an excessive amount of data.
            </para>

            <para>
               Hint: MAXDEPTH=2 can be very useful if you have a page that contains only the headlines that are links
               to the full text version of the articles. Many newstickers use this format.
            </para>

         <listitem> 
            <para>
               NOIMAGES: If you are not interested in downloading images then you use this tag. If specified all images
               will be replaced with the ALT-tag for the image if available, otherwise [img].
            </para>

            <para>
               Hint: NOIMAGES is an effective way to decrease the size of documents.

         <listitem> 
            <para>
               STAYONHOST: Most web sites contains references to both locally stored articles and to articles stored on
               other hosts.  Using a MAXDEPTH of 2 or higher could result in a lot of unwanted data. To prevent this
               you may specify the STAYONHOST tag for your link. The parser will now only download content that resides
               on the same server as the one that contained the top page. Together with exclusionlist.txt this is a
               quite handy way to prevent the download of links referred to by banners.

         <listitem> 
            <para>
               STAYBELOW=text: Similar to STAYONHOST this tag tells the parser to only fetch pages that start with text. For example,
               it could be used if the articles on a page are listed on another server in which case STAYONHOST would not work
               properly. Or you can grab certain articles out of a large listing so you would get all headlines but only articles
               referring to specific subjects (provided the web server offering the information is set up correctly).
            </para>

            <para>
               NOTE: If =text is not given, it will default to the content of the href-attribute (the URL you are pointing to).

         <listitem>

            </para>

            <para>
               NOTE: BPP=8 is currently only supported when the parser is used on a Windows system.

         An simple example of a description file is:

      <para>
         This would download the front page of our web site and also follow any links on the page if they are local to
         the host. No images would be downloaded.
      </para>

      <para>
         The description file (home.html) that is installed when your Plucker directory is set up, also contains a few examples.

      <title>Invoking the parser</title>

      <para>
         As the previous section showed, you can specify several options specific for each reference in the description
         file and many times this is enough. But additionally, the parser provides some global control through powerful
         command-line options and also a possibility to use different configurations that have been set up in the
         config file.
      </para>

      <para>
         In all the examples below we will call Spider.py directly. This could be stored in a script or we could create
         a symbolic link to it, e.g. if you have installed the Linux package you would use plucker-build instead of
         Spider.py in the examples.  A note for OS/2 and Windows users: running Spider.py as an executable program is a
         Unix trick and may not work on your platform. But do not worry, just list the Spider.py on an explicit python
         command line, that is use python Spider.py...  instead.
      </para>

      <para>
         The synopsis of the parser look like this:
      </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
   Spider.py -c | --update-cache | -f FILE | --doc-file=FILE [-N NAME | --doc-name=NAME]
             [-h | --help] [--compression=TYPE | --zlib-compression | --doc-compression]
             [-P DIR | --pluckerhome=DIR] [-v | -V NUM | --verbosity=NUM] [-q | --quiet]

      <para>
         Do not run away in fear of all these options, you don't have to use all of them...actually, you only have to
         use one of them (and that can be reduced to none if you set the file name of the document in the configuration
         file -- more about that later).
      </para>

         You can always get the list of the parameters by using the -h or --help option.

          <title>Control Over the Result</title>

          <para>
             The -c, --update-cache, -f, and --doc-file options allows you to specify if the parser should dump all
             records in a cache directory or if it shall create a document. For example, the command,
          </para>

<programlisting>
   % Spider.py -c
</programlisting>
 
          <para>
             tells the parser to dump all records in the cache directory in $PLUCKERDIR using the default description
             file (as you will see below it is possible to change the default description file in Plucker's config
             file). The --update-cache option works the same way as -c.
          </para>

          <para>
             If we instead used the following command,
          </para>

<programlisting>
   % Spider.py -f PluckerDB
</programlisting>

          <para>
             the parser would create a document called PluckerDB.pdb and store it in $PLUCKERDIR. The --doc-file option
             works the same way as -f. Either -c or -f must be given unless the document has been specified in the
             configuration file (see refsec:ConfigFile). The name of the document will default to the same as the name
             given to -f. If you want to give the document a different name, you can use the -N or --doc-name option,
          </para>

<programlisting>
   % Spider.py -f PluckerDB -N "Home Page"
</programlisting>

          <para>
             This will still create a document called PluckerDB.pdb in $PLUCKERDIR, but the name of the document (i.e.
             the name you would see on your Palm) would now be Home Page.
          </para>

          <para>
             The file name given to the -f option can contain an absolute or relative path, so if we run,
          </para>

<programlisting>
   % Spider.py -f /home/pilot/.plucker/DB/PluckerDB
</programlisting>

          <para>
             a document called PluckerDB.pdb will be stored in /home/pilot/.plucker/DB and if we run,
          </para>

<programlisting>
   % Spider.py -f DB/PluckerDB
</programlisting>

          <para>
             a document called PluckerDB.pdb will be stored in $PLUCKERDIR/DB (the same as above since $PLUCKERDIR in
             this case defaults to /home/pilot/.plucker/)
          </para>

          <para>
             To save space on the device all records are compressed and the parser provides two different types of
             compression, DOC compression and ZLib compression. The ZLib compression gives the best compression, but is
             only available for Palm OS 3.0 and later devices and also requires a shared library.
          </para>

          <para>
             You control the compression type by using the --compression=TYPE option. Allowable options are 'doc', for
             Palm DOC compression, or 'zlib', for zlib compression. You can also use the --zlib-compression or the
             --doc-compression option. If neither is given the parser defaults to DOC compression.
          </para>

          <para>
             To put the document in a specific category by default you can use the --category option. It is possible to
             give several default categories separated by ";".

             <para>
                The default operation of the parser is to parse the description file and any links in it, but this can
                be changed using the M or --maxdepth option. To make sure that we don't bite off more than we can chew,
                we can add the --stayonhost option to avoid following any external links,

                This would download the index page for Plucker's web site, any links within this page and also any
                links within those pages, but it would disregard any links outside the plkr.org host.
             </para>

             <para>
                These options are useful when you specify a specific host using -H. If you use a description file it is
                better to use the MAXDEPTH/STAYONHOST flags for each link instead.

             <para>
                The Plucker directory ($PLUCKERDIR) is the current working directory, while Plucker Home is like your
                home directory. They can be the same directory and the default behavior is that the Plucker directory
                is set to the same as Plucker Home (default for Plucker Home is $HOME/.plucker, but you can change this
                by using the environment variable $PLUCKERHOME).  plucker:/XXX files are first searched in $PLUCKERDIR
                then Plucker Home and any configuration files in the $PLUCKERDIR take precedence over those in the
                Plucker Home.

         The configuration file allows you to specify default values for global options. Under OS/2 and Windows this
         file should be called plucker.ini. For Windows, put this in Plucker Home or in the Plucker directory
         ($PLUCKERDIR). Under Unix/Linux, this file should be called pluckerrc if it is the system wide config file and
         .pluckerrc if it is a user config file. It should have been installed in the correct place (e.g. .pluckerrc
         should be in your home directory.)

         Entries are key = value pairs ordered into sections. A section is named and begins with a line in square

      </para>   

      <para>   
         All systems search the [DEFAULT] section. Under Windows, the [WINDOWS] section is also searched, OS/2 will
         search both the [OS2] and [POSIX] section and all other systems will search the [POSIX] section. Using the -s
         on the command line you can add other sections to search. The parser starts with the [DEFAULT] section, then
         the system dependent section(s) and last any sections defined on the command line. If a key is repeated the
         value for the last one will be used.

      <title>The Exclusion List</title>

      <para>
         Sometimes, the STAYONHOST and STAYBELOW attributes do not give enough selection ability to include only those
         things that you want included. The parser looks for so called exclusion lists in form of text files. It first
         loads the file $HOME/.plucker/exclusionlist.txt (if it exists), then it loads exclusionlist.txt in the
         directory you specified with the -p flag (again, only if it exists) and finally it loads any files specified
         on the command line using the -E option and/or found in the configuration file. A default exclusionlist.txt
         file is included with Plucker.
      </para>

      <para>The filter options in the exclusion list has a very flexible format:</para>

      <title>Use Cases</title>

      <para>To give you a few examples on how to use the parser in real life situations we will describe a number of
      different use cases. We start with showing how you pluck files located on your own system and then continues with
      examples for how to pluck files on remote hosts.</para>

      <para>In all the examples we will use /home/pilot/.plucker/ as our Plucker Home (and Plucker Directory). In this
      directory we have two subdirectories, one called HTML where we store all our different description files and one
      called DB used for storing the resulting documents.</para>

         <title>Pluck local targets</title>

         <para>The parser can handle any HTML or text document you have on your desktop system, whether it is simple
         text files or documents from a local web server you run on your desktop.</para>

         <sect3 id="eeaa">
            <title>Creating an E-book</title>

            <para>Handling E-books on your Palm is one of the things that Plucker does well. To create such E-books you
            first have to get the book in either text or (preferable) in HTML format -- Project Gutenberg: <ulink url="http://www.promo.net/pg/">http://www.promo.net/pg/</ulink> 
            is a good place to find several old classics and other free books. Some books can be found in the Open
            E-book (OEB) format. That format is close enough to HTML to be usable by the parser.</para>

            <para>In this example we will convert Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland using a copy in OEB
            format that we got from <ulink url="http://www.jeffkirvin.com/writingonyourpalm/recommends.htm">http://www.jeffkirvin.com/writingonyourpalm/recommends.htm</ulink>.
            After unpacking the file in the HTML subdirectory we have one large OEB file called
            alices_adventures_in_wonderland.htm and the procedure to convert this file into a Plucker document is very
            simple:</para>

            <para>We give it a different name than the document itself and also exclude the URL info (we don't need
            that in an E-book). From the output above you can also see that the document is split into several parts,
            since we for internal reasons must keep the text documents below 32 kB in size.</para>

            <title>An Admin Guide</title>

            <para>The previous example was only using one single file and this example will show you that it is just as
            simple when the book is divided up into several documents. We will use The Linux System Administrators'
            Guide by Lars Wirzenius and Joanna Oja as our test object.</para>

            <para>Unpacking the files in a separate directory (we will use /tmp/sag/ for this example) we will find
            several HTML documents and also a bunch of GIF images. We are interested in the images to find out what bit
            depth we have to use and also their size so we know if they will be scaled down. In this case all images
            are black and white, so we can use the default bit depth of 1. A few of the images are quite large, so they
            will be scaled down to 150x250 by the parser. If we really want these images in full size we can either
            change the HTML document so that instead of including the image in the document it will link to the image,
            i.e. instead of:</para>

            <para><![CDATA[<img src="overview-kernel.gif">]]></para>

            <para>we would use:</para>

            <para><![CDATA[<a href="overview-kernel.gif" BPP=1 MAXWIDTH=700 MAXHEIGHT=700>overview-kernel.gif</a>]]></para>

            <para>Then we can tap on the link to the image when we want to view it. This is something we can only do
            when we have access to the document and to support this in a more transparent way the parser should be able
            to do this automatically for you in the future.</para>

            <para>Since we are not interested in any external documents we will use the --stayonhost option and a high
            maximum depth. Then we don't have to worry about exactly how deep we should follow links and what external
            links we should filter out using exclusion lists. Now we are ready to build the document:</para>

            <title>Comics</title>

            <para>We need some fun, too, so let's download a few strips for some well known comics. To simplify things
            we will use a tool called netcomics to get the comics and then use a local description file to build the
            document. How to install netcomics is beyond this tutorial, but it is a Perl script and might work on any
            platform that have Perl support (for Linux users there exists pre-built packages). After you have installed
            netcomics, you should create a small shellscript called netcomics.sh to be used by the parser:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
#!/bin/sh

netcomics -D -d /tmp/Comics/ -c "ch dilbert dilbertcl uf"

( cd /tmp/Comics ; \
mv Dilbert-*.gif Dilbert.gif ; \
mv Dilbert_Classics-*.gif Dilbert_Classics.gif ; \
mv Calvin_and_Hobbes-*.gif Calvin_and_Hobbes.gif ; \
mv User_Friendly-*.gif User_Friendly.gif )
]]></programlisting>

            <para>On OS/2 and Windows this will look like the follwing. On OS/2 it should be named netcomics.cmd
            whereas on Windows it should be named netcomics.bat:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
perl netcomics.pl -D -d \temp\Comics\ -c "ch dilbert dilbertcl uf"

move Dilbert_Classics-*.gif Dilbert_Classics.gif
move Calvin_and_Hobbes-*.gif Calvin_and_Hobbes.gif
move User_Friendly-*.gif User_Friendly.gif
]]></programlisting>

            <para>This script will download Calvin & Hobbes, Dilbert, Dilbert Classic and UserFriendly to a separate
            directory (/tmp/Comics/) and rename the date specific files into a general format that can be used in the
            local description file:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[

            <para>To simplify things even further we will also add a new section for the comics:</para>

            file.</para>

            <para>As you can see we have added the shellscript as a command that should be run before the description
            file is parsed. Everyday (except on Sunday when the strips are too large for these options -- we will show
            a solution to that later in the section) we now only have to run:</para>

      Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone

      Preamble 
    </title>
    <para>
      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document "free" in the sense of
      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it,
      either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to
      get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
    </para>

    <para>
      This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free
      in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
      software.
    </para>

    <para>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free
      documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But
      this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
      matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose
      purpose is instruction or reference.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="1">
    <title>
      Applicability and Definitions 
    </title>
    <para>
      This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
      can be distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
      Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
    </para>

    <para>
      A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
      verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
    </para>

    <para>
      A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with
      the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
      matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.  (For example, if the
      Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
      relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
      commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
    </para>

    <para>
      The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
      Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
    </para>

    <para>
      The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts,
      in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
    </para>

    <para>
      A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
      is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
      generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
      available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
      variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
      whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A
      copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    </para>

    <para>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format,
      LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for
      human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
      by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
      available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
    </para>

    <para>
      The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
      hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not
      have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
      preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="2">
    <title>
      Verbatim Copying 
    </title>
    <para>
      You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that
      this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
      reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not
      use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
      distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number
      of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    </para>

    <para>
      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="3">
    <title>
      Copying in Quantity 
    </title>
    <para>
      If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires
      Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
      legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words
      of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
      changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions,
      can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed
      (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a
      machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
      added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using
      public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
      begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible
      at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
      through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any
      large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="4">
    <title>
      Modifications 
    </title>
    <para>
      You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above,
      provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling
      the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
      possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    </para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem>
   <para>
     Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
     previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use
     the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
   </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

   <para>
     List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the
     modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
     of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

     Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the
     Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These
     may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
     four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

    </orderedlist>

    <para>
      If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and
      contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
      invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license
      notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    </para>

    <para>
      You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified
      Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
      organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
    </para>

    <para>
      You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover
      Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one
      of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
      includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you
      are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
      the previous publisher that added the old one.
    </para>

    <para>
      The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for
      publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

      Combining Documents

      You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section
      4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all
      of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
      license notice.
    
</para>
    <para>

      The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be
      replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
      make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
      author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
      titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    
</para>
    <para>

      In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming
      one section entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections
      entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

      the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
      collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in
      all other respects.
    
</para>

      You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License,

      A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on
      a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
      provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate",
      and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of
      their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

      If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is
      less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround

      copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original
      versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also
