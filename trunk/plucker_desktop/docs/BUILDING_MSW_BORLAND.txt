Note: This was last updated back during wxWindows 2.3, alot has changed,
and if want to make with bcc, need to update the makefile.b32 first.
Probably a bakefile would be more helpful.

OVERVIEW
--------

This document describes how to build on Borland C++. There are 3 sections,
choose what you want to do:

(I) I just want to compile it for the first time, thanks.
(II) I want to compile it without the HTML editor's StyledTextControl (STC).
(III) I want to now make a debug build for development.

(I) I just want to compile it for the first time, thanks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Download Borland 5.5 and install to its default directory.
- Download Borland's service pack 1 (SP1) and install to its default directory.
- Download wxWindows 2.3.3 and install to the wx default directory.
- Do the recommended steps in the wxWindows install documents to setup the DOS
  environment and .cfg files.
- Build the wxWindows library in non debug mode:
    cd /wx/msw/src
    make makefile.b32 FINAL=1
- Build the XML resource library:
    cd /wx/contrib/src/xrc
    make -f makefile.b32 FINAL=1
- Build the wxStyledTextCtrl (stc) library:
    (1) cd /wx/contrib/stc/src
    (2) make -f makefile.b32 FINAL=1
    (3) Optionally: By default the generated stc library appears in /wx/contrib/lib.
        For convenience, you may wish to move it to wx/lib.
- Build plucker-desktop:
    cd to your plucker_desktop/ directory
    make -f makefile.b32 FINAL=1 WITHSTC=1
- A plucker-desktop executable is now available. Note It calls resources at
  run-time at specified locations, such as
  C:\Program Files\Plucker\plucker_desktop\resource\main_menu.xrc
  You can get these resources in the proper place by just downloading and
  existing Plucker Desktop installer, which will put the resources, etc
  into their proper place.

(II) I want to compile it without the HTML editor's StyledTextControl (STC).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

StyledTextControl (STC) is on by default for Borland compiler.
If want to have a go of it with it turned off instead:

- Have everything from a regular compile in step(I) above, done already.
- Open up <plucker_desktop_dir>/setup.h and turn off the flag for styled text in editor.
- Remake plucker-desktop, but without the WITHSTC=1 flag. Since you are making a
  non-debug build, you will include a FINAL=1
        >>>cd plucker_desktop/
        >>>make -f makefile.b32 clean
        >>>make -f makefile.b32 FINAL=1

(III) I want to now make a debug build for development.
-------------------------------------------------------

To get a debug build, have to be built with DLLs, otherwise the Borland linker can't
link, since the debug library is so big. Therefore, do the following steps:
- Clean and rebuild the wxWindows library in debug mode, with DLLs
  (wx2.3.3 had warnings of duplicate symbols but works okay):
        >>>cd /wx/msw/src
        >>>make makefile.b32 clean
        >>>make makefile.b32 DLL=1
- Build the XML resource library using the wx DLL and building a DLL (Note:
  there won't be a XRC dll anywhere, the wxxrc.lib will be correct though. As
  of wx2.3.3 was warnings of not using precompiled headers but works okay):
        >>>cd /wx/contrib/src/xrc
        >>>make -f makefile.b32 clean
        >>>make -f makefile.b32 WXUSINGDLL=1 WXBUILDDLL=1
- Build the wxStyledTextCtrl (stc) using the wx DLL and building a DLL (Note:
  there won't be a XRC dll anywhere, the wxstc.lib will be correct though):
        >>>cd /wx/contrib/stc/src
        >>>make -f makefile.b32 clean
        >>>make -f makefile.b32 WXUSINGDLL=1 WXBUILDDLL=1
    (3) Optionally: By default the generated stc library appears in /wx/contrib/lib.
        For convenience, you may wish to move it to wx/lib.
- Build plucker-desktop:
        >>>cd to your plucker_desktop/ directory
        >>>make -f makefile.b32 WXUSINGDLL=1 WITHSTC=1
- A plucker-desktop executable is now available. The wx.dll file needs to be
  in the same directory as the executable for things to run (or else in the
  system path somewhere perhaps is possible too). Note also, that it calls resources
  at run-time at specified locations, such as
  C:\Program Files\Plucker\plucker_desktop\resource\main_menu.xrc
  You can get these resources in the proper place by just downloading and
  existing Plucker Desktop installer, which will put the resources, etc
  into their proper place.

NOTE: The build absolutely have no FINAL=1 on any of the parts
(ie Plucker Desktop needs to be built without FINAL=1 since the library was
built without FINAL=1. They must match. Otherwise you will get weird errors.)

wxMSW viewing debugging information
--------------------------------------

If compiled wxWindows and the application as a debug build, then debugging
messages are sent to the OS.
To watch debugging information:
-For Windows, there is a freeware debugging tool to watch the debug
 messages scroll by in the debug build of plucker-desktop.exe.
 It is downloadable from: 
 http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml
 This tool also ships in the wxWindows distribution for Windows.
