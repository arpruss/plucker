----------------------------------
Note: If you have OS X 10.4, with XCode, your life will be much easier if you use xcode instead
of using these instructions. I couldn't quite get it to finish with just commandline GCC, so used XCode
instead.

See the accompanying file, BUILDING_MACINTOSH_OSX_XCODE.txt, and use those instructions instead.
------------------------------------

----------------------------------
Setting up your system to develop:
----------------------------------

1) If you don't have a shortcut (alias) to the Terminal in your Dock yet, I recommend adding it. Open up /Applications/Utilties/ and drag the "Terminal" icon onto the dock.

2) You need to be able to do superuser things in the Terminal. This isn't on by default on OSX. Turn it on in the "NetInfo Manager" Utility, which is at /Applications/Utilites/NetInfo.What I did in this utility was "Security>Authenticate" and entering my user password to "log in" to make changes. Then it was Security>Enable Superuser, which asked my to type in a superuser password and confirm it. It then automatically logs out, and you can quit this utility.

3) Install the developer tools if you haven't already. 

----------------------------------
Setting up wxWidgets:
----------------------------------

4) Download wxWidgets. I recommend the wxAll package.
Unzip this wxWindows zipfile and place the folder somewhere you want to work with it (for example ~/Documents/wxWidgets).

5) Install wxWidgets. You may wish to refer to your  <wxdir>/docs/mac/install.txt under the section "Apple Developer Tools".

5A) Click on your "Terminal" icon in the Dock, and do the following commands at the commandline.

5A) cd into the base dir (like ~/Documents/wxWindows or whatever you unzipped to in step 4).
5B) mkdir build-debug-version
5C) cd build-debug-version
5D) ../configure --disable-shared --enable-debug --enable-mac --enable-unicode (and I think --enable-universal_binary though says not yet working)
Note the ../ at the start of the configure, since you are doing it from within your build dir.
(Note: if/when changing your ../configure options, I am pretty sure that you need to do a make cleanall to get rid of the setup.h files that have settings in them, otherwise you will be still using your old settings from the previous configure run.
Note: As of wxMac 2.4.0, you can't configure out some things yet like --disable-printarch, so just roll them all in for now.)

5E) make

Note: You need a superuser password setup by now. If you don't, go back up to step 2 and do it.
5F) su
5G) <YOUR PASSWORD>
5H) make install
5I) exit
And alternative here is: sudo make install

8) You need to have /usr/local/bin in the path, so unless you have already done so earlier, type this:
set path=($path /usr/local/bin). 
This will only last for that terminal session. You need to retype that each time unless you make it permanent somewhere in the bowels of OSX (or I add it to the osx makefile). 
Let me repeat that: You need to type 
set path=($path /usr/local/bin)
every time to open a new terminal window and you want to compile plucker-desktop.

---------------------------------------------------
Changes to above in were running off CVS wxWidgets:
---------------------------------------------------
Before starting, in the root wx directory, run 
autoconf
and then I ran
sh autogen.sh 
for good measure.

----------------------------------
Building Plucker Desktop:
----------------------------------

9) Now you are ready to compile plucker-desktop.
9A) Download the plucker sourcecode either via CVS or as a CVS snapshot download from www.plkr.org. If you are using a CVS snapshot, then extract the zip file to a directory of your choosing (for example ~/Documents/wxwindows_projects/plucker)
9B) In your terminal window, cd to the *main* plucker directory (not the plucker_desktop directory)
9C) Type this: sh autogen.sh
9D) Some autodetection scripts will scroll by and plucker will configure itself for your OSX box. 
9E) You probably don't have the PalmOS compile tools. If no PalmOS SDK, then enter 
./configure --disable-palmosbuild
Otherwise just skip ahead to step 9E.
9E) cd plucker_desktop 
9F) make

10) Now you can make the plucker-desktop OSX bundle. From the plucker_desktop directory:
10A) cd installer
10B) cd osx
10C) make

Frustratingly, at the time of the writing, it won't quite link for me. My suspicion is that wx-config on wxMac 2.8 is returning a wrong value, (2.5), or its the universal_binary, or whatever, but XCode works fine.

Now you have a Plucker.app in the plucker/plucker_desktop/installer/osx dir. It has a little icon. Double click it in the Finder to start.
