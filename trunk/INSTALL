Installing Plucker
==================

Basically there are only a few simple steps to get this running for
yourself. First check the file REQUIREMENTS to make sure you have the tools
required to run Plucker. Then depending on the OS you use do the following:

-----------
Unix/Linux:
-----------

  For more detailed information, please see README files in the
  'parser/python' subdirectory for their usage and additional parameters.

  1. If you have downloaded a binary package of Plucker, it is not necessary
     to "build" the package, you simply set up your environment and install
     the Plucker viewer application by running the 'install-plucker' script
     found in the 'unix' subdirectory.  This will create a few directories
     on your system and install the parser components into them and also
     install the default configuration files that allow Plucker to run on
     your system.

     If you have downloaded a source package of Plucker, first running
     'autoreconf' and then 'configure' with your parameters from the
     top-level directory will first build all the different parts of Plucker
     using the proper development tools and SDK installs (see the README
     file in the viewer directory for more detailed instructions describing
     how to build the viewer and shared library).

     With the binary package all these files are already included and the
     script will just install them into their proper locations.

  2. Edit and change the home page (which links to all other pages) by
     changing the ~/.plucker/home.html file found underneath your home
     directory. You can edit the other files too. You can also edit
     ~/.pluckerrc (also in your home directory), to set up the default
     behavior of the parser.

  3. Run 'plucker-build' to download the web pages to your system and build
     the .pdb files which you can transfer to your Palm handheld device and
     view with Plucker.

-----
OS/2:
-----
  for more info see README.OS2.

  1. You set up your environment and install the viewer application
     by running:

     install_os2 <path> <port>

     <path> represents the path to which you want to install
            the plucker package.
            e.g. E:\PalmPilot\Plucker

     <port> represents the COM-Port you Palm is connected to.
            If no port is specified COM1 is assumed by default.
            e.g. COM1

  2. After creating a suitable HOME.HTML (found in $Home\.plucker) you 
     may want to retrieve the data. Open a connection to the internet 
     using OS/2's dial-function, and simply start "Plucker Hotsync". 
     If your environment is set up correctly Plucker starts to retrieve 
     the pages you mentioned in HOME.HTML.

  NOTE: Maybe you'll need to set HOME-environment-variable in your CONFIG.SYS
  prior to calling install_os2. To do this simply add a line like

  SET HOME=F:/home

  and create the directory F:/home by

  F:
  md home

  if you want to place your HOME on drive F: If you already use Unix-style
  software (GNU-tools, XFree86/2 etc.) this variable may be already set.
  If you've any problems with this stuff, feel free to mailto:a.wagner@teamos2.de.
  (You may also use write in German)

--------
Windows:
--------

  On Windows we encurage you to use the graphical installer we provide. It will
  take care about all steps necessary to set up Plucker correctly.
  
  The following steps are necessary to get Plucker running on Windows using
  this installer:

   * Download the Installer package for Windows from our web page and run it.
   * Follow the on-screen instructions.

--------
Mac OS X
--------
  
  On OS X, your best bet is a graphical package that has all the 
  image parsers, etc. It requires OS X 10.2 or higher. Just open the .dmg
  and drag the 'Plucker' icon to your /Applications folder. Double click
  to start.

  You can also download source and run stuff from a terminal. See
  http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020312222959415 for more
  information.
