' This VBA Macro is for use in MS-Outlook.
' It will write all plucker notes to a file so you can use it,
' You can easily change the code so the notes are deleted
' You can also easily change the code so the notes are put
' together into one note.
' 
' I use this code together with some javascript in a static web page
' to open all the URLs when I am at my desktop computer:
' The makro starts an editor, I use that to delete all the
' non-URL lines, then cut-and-paste to a textarea field in the web page
' and push a button that opens all the pages at once.
