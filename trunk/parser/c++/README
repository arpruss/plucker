Plucker C++ spider/parser 
By Bill Nalen (bill@nalens.com)
copyright (c) 2003

For creating Plucker documents (see http://www.plkr.org)

Linux version:
	Requires libhttp >= 0.9 from http://www.SoftOrchestra.com/downloads
	Requires ImageMagick 'libMagick++' library to convert images
		to palm format:
		http://www.imagemagick.org/
	Requires patch (diff included) to magic.xml so libMagic++
		will recognize PALM format images.
		(/usr/local/share/ImageMagick-X.X.X/config/magic.xml)

Winders version:
	Needs Image support. (ImageMagick should work, but, needs testing.)

Both:
	Meta document generation doesn't work.
	Http parsing needs some work.
