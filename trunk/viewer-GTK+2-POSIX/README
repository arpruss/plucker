This is a viewer for the Plucker document format which uses the GTK+2
graphics toolkit, and POSIX system calls.  It should run on any
platform which provides those two items.

To build, first install GTK+, version 2.0 or later.  Build and install
the libunpluck.a library from the tools/unpluck subdirectory of the
Plucker source distribution.  Then edit the Makefile in this directory
to point to the location of GTK+, and the location of unpluck.  If you
have freetype2, edit the location of it.  Otherwise remove all
references to the freetype2 library.  Finally, edit the location of
the X11 home, if different from the normal Linux value.

Type "make" to build the viewer.
