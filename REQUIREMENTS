It should be possible to get Plucker running on other Unix systems 
too.  If you get it running on some system not listed above, then 
please notify us so we can add it to the list. We can be reached 
at plucker-team@rubberchicken.org


Development (in general)
------------------------

To configure the source, you will need various tools, depending on
what sections of the project you are working on.  See the below
sections for information on specific tools.

In general, to configure the system, you will need GNU Autoconf 2.13.
Do not try to use 2.5x; it seems to have oddities that don't work with
our configure.in file.

To configure, do not run "configure" directly; instead, run the
top level shell script "autogen.sh", passing it the options you would
normally pass to configure.


Palm OS viewer development
--------------------------

If you want to compile the viewer you have to install the necessary
development tools (and make sure that they are in your path). 

Where you find the tools:

prc-tools:              http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/
SDK5:                   http://www.palmos.com/cgi-bin/sdk50.cgi
pilrc (v2.8 or later):  http://www.pilrc.com/

See the README in the viewer dir for additional info.


Python distiller development
----------------------------

You will need to have Python (1.5.2 or later) and one of the
image-processing libraries detailed above installed to work on the
distiller.  You should have the full path to the directory
"SRC/parser/python" in your PYTHONPATH environment variable.  You can
run the distiller with the command line:

 $ python /SRC/parser/python/PyPlucker/Spider.py [command-line-args]


Java distiller development
--------------------------

The Java distiller *is* the Python distiller, so to work on the
functionality of it, you will need the same things you need for the
Python distiller.  To compile the Java jar file for it, you will need
in addition Java (1.2 or later), Jython (2.1 or later) and the Java
Imaging Utilities (JIU) image-processing library (0.10.0 or later).


Documentation development
-------------------------

If you want to build or work on the Documentation, you will also need
LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML and its associated tools -- Perl 5, TeX, dvips,
ghostscript, and netpbm (see the Latex2HTML docs for info on where to
obtain these).  You will also need GNU sed.

LaTeX:       ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/
Latex2HTML:  http://ctan.tug.org/ctan/tex-archive/support/latex2html
GNU sed:     ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/sed/

NOTE: the latex2html installation must support GIF images.


Plucker Desktop Development
---------------------------

If you want to compile Plucker Desktop, you will need the 
Free wxWindows cross-platform C++ development toolkit. 
Version 2.4.2 or higher of wxWindows higher is required. 

A C++ compiler supported by wxWindows is also needed: GCC on POSIX
systems, Borland or MSVC or Cygwin on Microsoft Windows are the 
recommended compilers, and the built-in free Developer Tools 
GCC compiler on Apple OS X, but all common C++ compilers can be used.

See the plucker_desktop/docs/BUILDING*.txt files for full
details and step-by-step instructions for Linux, Microsoft Windows 
and others.
