NEWS for Plucker veterans
-------------------------

- 1.9

  User stuff:
  
  * Full screen support on T3 and T5.  (Alexander Pruss)

  * Menu option for sorting the documents in the Document Library
    (Michael Nordström)

  * Documents can be sorted by category. (Michael Nordström)

  * If a document contains a publication date then that date will
    be displayed instead of the file creation date (Michael Nordström)

  * Rot13 support in the Export to Memo form. (Brad Sawatzky)

  * Initial right-to-left rendering support. (Dov Feldstern)

  * On devices running Palm OS 4.0 or later the date in the 
    document library will depend on the time zone. (Michael Nordström)

  Development stuff:

  * Exact anchor support now in viewer.  Still needs to go into parser(s).

  * Moved rotate setting to preferences.


- 1.8

  User stuff:

  * i-mode support (Dave Maddock)

  * The 5-way support in the library has been changed. (Michael Nordström)

    New behaviour:

      - If the list of documents is only one page then the fiveway will
        be activated from the beginning.

      - If the displayed list of documents includes the last accessed
        document then the fiveway will be activated.

      - The select/centre button will activate the fiveway and the
        initially selected document will be the last accessed document
        or if that document isn't visible the document at the middle of
        the page will be selected. When the fiveway is activated the
        select/centre button will open the selected document.

      - The up/down button will either scroll the list one page up/down
        (when the fiveway isn't activated) or select the previous/next
        document in the list (when the fiveway is activated).

      - The left button will deactivate the fiveway or if the fiveway
        isn't activated it will exit the viewer. When the list of
        documents is only one page pressing left will exit the viewer
        instead of deactivate the fiveway.

      - The right button will display the popup list with different
        actions for the selected document (when the fiveway is activated).
        When the fiveway isn't activated the right button will not result
        in any action.

  * The following preferences have been removed,

      - "Enable dynamic scrollbar"; always disabled.

      - "Enable visual aid"; always enabled.

      - "Click sound for links"; always enabled (i.e. it uses the
        setting for "system sound").

  Internal version


- 0.03

  User stuff:

  * Inline and linked image support! (Mark Lillywhite)

    If you have information about problems please let us know. Thanks 
    to Michael Nordström and Andreas Gaufer.

    to the serial port. (It doesn't work all that great, but it's better then
    what we had before!).

  Other stuff:

  * There is work proceeding apace on a new parser, written in Perl, which 
    should make Plucker much easier to use.

  * Many bugs fixed


- 0.02

  This is a really small update to plucker. It attempts to make the viewer run
  on PalmOS units other than PalmOS 3; it appears to work on PalmOS 2.5, and
  it's possible it will now run on PalmOS 1.
