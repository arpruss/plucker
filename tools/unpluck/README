This directory contains a library to access the records of a Plucker
document, as well as some of the metadata about the document such as
the title.

To build this, you will need

 * the zlib library, from www.gzip.org/zlib/, version 1.1.4 or later.

The key file here is unpluck.c, which provides access to the records
and data of a Plucker document.  The exported functions are documented
in unpluck.h.
