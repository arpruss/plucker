This directory contains an 'exploder' program, which writes a Plucker
document to a specified directory as a set of HTML files and JPEG
image files.  The exploder app is included mainly as a test of the
libunpluck library.

To build this, you will need

 * libunpluck.a, from ../unpluck;
 * the libjpeg library, version 6b or later, from www.ijg.org;
 * the zlib library, from www.gzip.org/zlib/, version 1.1.4 or later.

Make sure the include headers for libjpeg and libz are in your
CPPFLAGS; if they are in non-standard places, you may need to set the
CPPFLAGS environment variable before configuring Plucker.  Similarly,
make sure the library directories for -lz and -ljpeg are on the LIBS
path, if they are in non-standard locations.

"explode" has the following usage:

  explode PLUCKERDOC_FILENAME [DIRECTORY]

which means that the Plucker document in PLUCKERDOC_FILENAME will be
exploded into DIRECTORY.  If no DIRECTORY is specified, a new one will
be created in a suitable temporary location.  If a DIRECTORY is
specified, there should be no output from explode; if not, explode
will write the name of the temporary directory to stdout.  The root
file for viewing will be DIRECTORY/default.html.

Once you have the exploder compiled, it's fairly easy to make a helper
app to show Plucker format docs in a Web browser.  The MIME type is

  application/prs.plucker

the file extension is "plkr", and a helper program for netscape 4 is
in netscape4-plucker-helper (which does NOT get automatically installed).
