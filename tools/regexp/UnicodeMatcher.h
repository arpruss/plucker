/**
  A matcher is a non thread-safe object used to scan strings using a given
  {@link UnicodePattern UnicodePattern} object. Using a <code>UnicodeMatcher</code> is the preferred
  method for scanning strings. UnicodeMatchers are not thread-safe. UnicodeMatchers require
  very little dynamic memory, hence one is encouraged to create several
  instances of a matcher when necessary as opposed to sharing a single instance
  of a matcher.
  <p>
  The most common methods needed by the matcher are <code>matches</code>,
  <code>findNextMatch</code>, and <code>getGroup</code>. <code>matches</code>
  and <code>findNextMatch</code> both return success or failure, and further
  details can be gathered from their documentation.
  <p>
  Unlike Java's <code>UnicodeMatcher</code>, this class allows you to change the string
  you are matching against. This provides a small optimization, since you no
  longer need multiple matchers for a single pattern in a single thread.
  <p>
  This class also provides an extremely handy method for replacing text with
  captured data via the <code>replaceWithGroups</code> method. A typical
  invocation looks like:
  <pre>
  wchar_t buf[10000];
  std::wstring str = "\\5 (user name \\1) uses \\7 for his/her shell and \\6 is their home directory";
  FILE * fp = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r");
  UnicodePattern::registerUnicodePattern("entry", "[^:]+");
  UnicodePattern * p = UnicodePattern::compile("^({entry}):({entry}):({entry}):({entry}):({entry}):({entry}):({entry})$",
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UnicodePattern::MULTILINE_MATCHING | UnicodePattern::UNIX_LINE_MODE);
  UnicodeMatcher * m = p->createUnicodeMatcher("");
  while (fgets(buf, 9999, fp))
  {
  &nbsp;&nbsp;m->setString(buf);
  &nbsp;&nbsp;if (m->matches())
  &nbsp;&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("%s\n", m->replaceWithGroups(str).c_str());
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
  fclose(fp);

  </pre>
  Calling any of the following functions before first calling
  <code>matches</code>, <code>findFirstMatch</code>, or
  <code>findNextMatch</code> results in undefined behavior and may cause your
  program to crash.
  <code>
  <ul>
    <li>replaceWithGroups</code>
    <li>getStartingIndex</li>
    <li>getEndingIndex</li>
    <li>getGroup</li>
    <li>getGroups</li>
  </ul>
  </code>
  <p>
  The function <code>findFirstMatch</code> will attempt to find the first match
  in the input string. The same results can be obtained by first calling
  <code>reset</code> followed by <code>findNextMatch</code>.
  <p>
  To eliminate the necessity of looping through a string to find all the
  matching substrings, <code>findAll</code> was created. The function will find
  all matching substrings and return them in a <code>vector</code>. If you need
  to examine specific capture groups within the substrings, then this method
  should not be used.
